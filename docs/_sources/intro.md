# Industrial Python: The Book

Python is just another dynamically typed, interpreted, high level programming language. Python is quite fun to learn and use at work. But learning a programming language is one thing and building software applications is another. Python may be easy for some and tough for some, but building applications that work in production environment requires more that just knowing the language. It's a combination of code, design, computer science principles, a variety of other tools and much more.
This book is an effort to bridge the gap between what's taught in programming courses vs what happens when one enters IT industry.
We'll cover introduction to python, diving into language specifics and then jump to practical use cases for python. Wherever possible you will find examples and problems for you to solve by yourself.

This book is built using jupyter-book and github pages. This has few benefits:
1. The book keeps improving as time passes and the reader always accesses an updated copy of the book.
2. Since a programming language can be learnt only by writing and executing code, jupyter-book makes it easy for the reader to quickly jump to action using online tools(google-colab, binder etc.) to run the code snippets.
3. Since the book itself is a collection of notebooks one can run the code locally or online.   

Happy learning.
